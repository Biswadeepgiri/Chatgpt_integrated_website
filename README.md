This is a Chatgpt Integrated website built using React JS and Vite and used Express JS and Node JS for the backend part.

I used the OpenAI api to send a request to the chatgpt api sever and catch the response and display it on my website.

To Run the program do these steps -

1) "cd server" and then "npm start"

2) "cd client" and then "npm run dev"
